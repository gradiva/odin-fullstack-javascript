##  Basic Informational Site

[*Beginner Node Project*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/basic-informational-site)
following The Odin Project [NodeJS](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs).

This project is about creating a very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404 to practice basic routing. 

## Notes

Learned about `path.resolve([...paths])` to deal with absolute paths. Reference [here](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html#path_path_resolve_paths).

Found this useful utility called [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) that automatically restarts the server upon any changes in the source code. 

The folder express-version contains the same exercise using express.

## Run

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start` starts the server
3. `npm run start:watch` starts and monitors the server, using nodemon.
