## Design teardown

[*Visual hierarchy*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/design-teardown)
following The Odin Project [HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3).

## Notes

The original exercise suggested to build the heat map for [this site](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/), but I did not really identify a clear visual hierarchy, so decided to do it for [this other site](https://evernote.com/) instead.
