## Mint form clone

[*Mint form clone*](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/html-forms)
following The Odin Project [HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3).

This project is about building a clone (only appearance) for the Mint form based on HTML and CSS. 

## Notes

I learned about semantic HTML elements and HTML5 types for inputs *password *number *tel *email. 
It was a fun project.
